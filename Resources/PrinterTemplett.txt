Watch the reset video or perform the steps. After resetting,
you generally have 2 hours to complete the setup. Decide if
you want to connect the printer to the router or to print
directly to the printer and bypass the router.<br><br>Many
HP and other OEM printers have problems with the router when
the router has two bands and <font color="#FF6600">both bands
have the same name (SSID)</font>.  Log into the modem and
rename one of the bands. Alternately, contact your ISP and
have them rename a band.<br><br>Or simply <b>use Wi-Fi direct</b>
(but read note below about Instant Ink).<br><br><table border="2">

<b>You may need to reset your printer</b>.  
<p>Disconnecting the USB cable may still leave the printer
in the wired or Wi-Fi mode. Connecting an ethernet cable may
still leave the printer in Wi-Fi mode.  The Wi-Fi reset is
used to put Wi-Fi printers into setup mode.  Some resets
are simple and others require a video to understand.  Factory
resets cannot be revealed in this forum. To do a factory reset
of your printer, you must contact HP.

<!-- @IDNetwork Connect@ TimeStamp=DDDDDDDD_TTTTTT -->
<b>Wi-Fi connection</b><p>
Ideally, your Wi-Fi printer should connect to the modem or router.
If your network has multiple boosters / repeaters, it is possible
the printer may connect randomly to any of the units.  The
router needs to provide the same IP address on every connection.
This rarely happens with random connects.  An alternate Wi-Fi
connection is <b>Wi-Fi direct</b>.  Your laptop or smartphone prints
directly to the printer and does not go through the router.
Note that if you signed up for instant ink or internet
printing your printer must also be online through the router.
<b>Do not</b> call any phone number revealed in any video or site.</p>

HP updates software periodically.  Downloads shown below may

operating system (OS) first.  If windows 11 is missing then
use 10.  You can go as far back as Windows 7, 64bit to get
missing drivers. After selecting the OS click the blue
