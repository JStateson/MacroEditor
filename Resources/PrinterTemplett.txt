<!-- @IDReset Printer@ TimeStamp=DDDDDDDD_TTTTTT -->
<b>You may need to reset your printer</b>.  
<p>Disconnecting the USB cable may still leave the printer
in the wired or Wi-Fi mode. Connecting an ethernet cable may
still leave the printer in Wi-Fi mode.  The Wi-Fi reset is
used to put Wi-Fi printers into setup mode.  Some printers
have a semi-reset, a full reset and a factory reset.  Please
refer to the user manual to find the difference. Some resets
are simple and others require a video to understand.  Factory
resets cannot be revealed in this forum. To do a factory reset
of your printer, you must contact HP.

<br>Wi-Fi reset instructions and videos (if any) are shown below.
Generally you have 2 hours to connect your printer after
performing the Wi-Fi reset.  Note that a reset video may show
a slightly different model than yours.  <b>Do not</b> call any phone
numbers shown in any of the videos unless an HP video or site.</p>

<!-- @IDNetwork Connect@ TimeStamp=DDDDDDDD_TTTTTT -->
<b>Wi-Fi connection</b><p>
Ideally, your Wi-Fi printer should connect to the modem or router.
If your network has multiple boosters / repeaters, it is possible
the printer may connect randomly to any of the units.  The
router needs to provide the same IP address on every connection.
This rarely happens with random connects.  An alternate Wi-Fi
connection is Wi-Fi direct.  Your laptop or smartphone prints
directly to the printer and does not go through the router.
Note that if you signed up for instant ink or internet
printing your printer must also be online through the router.
<b>Do not</b> call any phone numbers shown in any of the videos
unless an HP video or site.

<b>Software</b><p>
HP updates software periodically.  Downloads shown below may
be old.  You should always visit the Software and Download
page to look for new releases. You may need to select an
operating system (OS) first.  If windows 11 is missing then
use 10.  You can go as far back as Windows 7, 64bit to get
missing drivers. After selecting the OS click the blue
