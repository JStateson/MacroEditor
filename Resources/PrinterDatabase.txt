Special app macro flags building with visual studio
SPECIAL application macro
SPECIAL are flags to compile the app for the purpose of retro-fixing macros or creating a unique table or list.

SPECIAL 1 is defined in utils.cs
It was used to create the color tables that
are in the signatures file.
The input to create the color tables is the commented text at the bottom of utils.cs
Note that background color is no longer allowed in either the HP macros source editor 
or the HP reply editor.  To get background color you need to save the HTML as an
 image and upload the image.

SPECIAL 2 and 3 are in main.cs
and were used to correct existing table and list macros.  The corrections are only
 needed for those macros that are to be used in the HP macro settings page. The HTML
 works correctly in any browser but is detected as an error in the HP settings.  
This is only needed for existing macros that were coded using normal HTML rules. 
 The code in this app (MacroViewer) is currently coded for HP rules so (hopefully) 
no non-HP HTML code is being generated.

SPECIAL 2 handles border sizes that are not allowed in HP macros.  You can set the
 border of a table to any size but it needs to be '1' if used in the HP macro settings.
 Otherwise just copy the web page text into a reply. It is only when the source is
 copied into the macro settings that HP site refuses to allow the size.

SPECIAL 3 handles missing <tr> and a few other stange problems
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; needs a space to become
&lt;tr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt; and a missing &lt;tr&gt; is supplied where needed.

SPECIAL 4 was supposed to identify any %50 that need to be %100 width.  
Images can fit in %50 but URLS and text usually need %100.  This is not used.

Building with Visual Studio 2022.
When buildig the release application, the post build command will copy all the
 macros in the release folder into the debug folder and also a temp folder. 
 The temp folder will be compressed using tar along with the executable.
Note that any macros in the debug folder will be overwritten with the release macros.
